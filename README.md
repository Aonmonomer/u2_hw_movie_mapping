## Overview

We'll be building a simple movie application that renders movies and genres to practice mapping over components and passing data with props. You'll be creating 2 new components to accomplish this.

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Create a `components` folder inside of src


## Instructions
### Data
Within the data folder in `src` take a close look at the structure of the data in `movies.json`.
- What does this data look like?
- What sort of information can we get about each movie?

Import the data from `movies.json` into `App.js`.
```js
import movieArray from './data/movies.json'
```


components folder
Movie.js component
